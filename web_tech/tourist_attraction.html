                <p>The Kaziranga National Park is home to two-thirds of the planet’s population of the one-horned rhinoceros. Apart from that, 
                    this national park is also a World Heritage Site and a major highlight on the Assam tourist places map. It’s vibrant, well 
                    preserved, sustained ecology, and a versatile biodiversity is what contributes to keeping this place on the top of the list of 
                    tourist places in Assam. Other than the one-horned Rhino, the park draws its popularity from other pleasant surprises like the 
                    Swamp Deer, Elephants, Wild Buffalos, Chinese Pangolins, Bengal Foxes, Gibbons, Civets, Sloth Bears, Leopards, and Flying 
                    Squirrels to name a few. It’s also a tiger reserve since it houses an enormous population of the royal Bengal Tigers, making it 
                    one of the most important Assam points of interest. This is certainly among the best places to visit in Assam.

                    famous for the rare golden langur and the adorable red panda, Manas is one of the best national parks in Assam and even all of 
                    India for those who wish to witness the rare species of India’s flora. It’s one of the best tourist attractions in Assam owing 
                    to not only its rich biodiversity but also for its stunning scenery and surreal natural landscape ranging from forested hills, 
                    alluvial grasslands, and tropical evergreen forests. Home to India’s second-largest tiger population, it harbours the maximum 
                    population of endangered Indian species as listed in the IUCN Red Book.

                    Majuli’s eye-warming naturescapes make it one of the top tourist places in Assam. It is the world’s largest riverine island as well as one of the most important Satras established by Sankardeva and Madhavdev. The Majuli islands are spread over an area of around 452 sq km and most of these get submerged under water during the monsoons, leaving the bigger islands like Kamalabari, Auniati, and Garamur on the surface. This is why it’s best to visit this place in Guwahati in May. This is undoubtedly among the best places to visit in Assam. Apart from having remarkable natural beauty, Majuli is also a birdwatcher’s paradise. A holiday in Assam is incomplete without seeing one of the most beautiful places to visit in Assam.
